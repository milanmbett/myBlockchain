<h2>Blockchain:</h2>
A chain of blocks that contain a signature for the previous block and some data. Essentially a linked-list that contains special properties that makes the data structure immutable ,verifiable, and append-only.

<h2>Block:</h2>
Each block has the hash of the previous block which helps to calculate the current block's hash. This makes it so that calculating and comparing hashes allows us to see if a blockchain is invalid.
